# Code Refactor Starter Code
The starter HTML code was missing a title and had plenty of IDs and classes that were not needed. I replaced them with classes that linked similar items together. Also I replaced the <div> with 
HTML semantics such as <nav> and <article>. The CSS of the starter code was similar to the HTML. It had too many repeatable lines of code that would have the similar
function under one class. Creating a classes that would hold multiple of the same item would help load the website faster and make the code easier to read.
